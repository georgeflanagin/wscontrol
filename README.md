# wscontrol
Python program to remotely control a collection of Linux workstations.

Many of us in HPC and other Academic Research Computing groups 
deal with an environment that is just as bare bones on the 
administrative side as it is on the calculation side. 

This
program is intended to be operable with a minimum of constraints.
At University of Richmond each member of the academic research
environment is likely to have a private workstation that is not
often used for calculations, but is a Linux computer connected
to the same network as the research computers. It is in this
environment that we execute `wscontrol`, or _workstation control_.
